Global adoption of cryptocurrency has been a significant challenge since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009. The need for scaling and speeding up Bitcoin to make it globally accessible and competitive with centralized solutions has been a persistent issue. Over the years, Bitcoin's conservative approach to innovation led to the abandonment of the idea of a scalable currency, favoring the concept of "Digital Gold."

Enthusiasts and professionals seeking to enhance Bitcoin's scalability were motivated to create new networks. As these networks emerged, the vision of a scalable Bitcoin became overshadowed by a multitude of diverse ideas and ambitious goals, leading to the development of various branches of financial cryptography. Today, the cryptocurrency landscape features numerous networks, yet arguably none are capable of achieving true global scalability. These networks can be categorized into two groups: Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks, which adhere to Bitcoin's ethos, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks, which draw inspiration from Bitcoin but operate on fundamentally different principles.

The scaling potential of both PoW and PoS will be explored, highlighting how scientific research has refined and improved the scalability of PoW, while also addressing why PoS cannot leverage these academic advancements due to its inherent structure.

A critical issue in the cryptocurrency space is the costliness associated with consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work, first implemented by Bitcoin, relies on costly digital signatures to achieve decentralized consensus without a central point of trust. Prior to Bitcoin, protocols struggled to eliminate internal points of trust, but Bitcoin successfully delegated these points to the mining process, which involves a chain-linked structure where transactions are grouped into blocks, and a hash solution is produced that meets the network's self-adjusting difficulty.

Following Bitcoin's introduction, some argued that costly digital signatures were unnecessary for decentralized consensus and proposed Proof of Stake as an alternative. This argument posits that instead of incurring high computational costs, coin holders can lock their currency for a set period to participate in consensus. While this simplified view of PoS may appear appealing, a deeper examination reveals significant shortcomings.

Without the costliness of mining, any protocol risks reverting to a lower security threshold. PoW networks enjoy 50% Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), while PoS networks are limited to 33% BFT. This discrepancy raises important questions about the implications of BFT on security, scalability, and potential vulnerabilities.

In PoW, distribution occurs solely through mining, assuming a fair launch. The costliness of mining ensures that the distribution process is unforgeable and equitable, rewarding participants based on their contributions. A miner with a large mining facility receives compensation proportional to that of a home miner with a few machines. However, removing the costliness of block production undermines fair distribution. Many PoS networks exploit the absence of cost to implement distribution schemes that disproportionately benefit founders, insiders, and venture capitalists.

This situation draws parallels between PoS networks and equity financing in traditional finance. Just as companies raise capital by selling shares, PoS networks can sell portions of their coin supply to various stakeholders, including venture capitalists and service providers. For instance, during Ethereum's launch, the founders allocated 12 million ETH to themselves and sold an additional 60 million coins, raising significant capital.

The coin supply in PoW is directly tied to real-world energy and resource expenditures, while PoS networks often lack this connection. The unfair distribution practices in popular PoS networks can lead to early investors gaining disproportionate influence and control over the network, exacerbating issues of centralization.

The supply fairness and manipulation problem is just one of many challenges stemming from the abandonment of costly block production. Each PoS network has unique adaptations and trade-offs, but all remain vulnerable to critical attacks and exploits. One notable attack vector is the "Wrench Attack," where attackers can target validators' keys, leading to severe consequences for the network's consensus.

If the staked supply is small, the impact on consensus may be minimal, but with a larger staked supply, compromised keys can halt finalization and prevent consensus. If attackers control 34% of the supply, they can permanently disrupt the network unless intervention occurs. This vulnerability, termed "Weak Subjectivity," arises because newly syncing or out-of-sync validators cannot distinguish between the true ledger history and a forged one without an external source of trust.

In contrast, PoW requires an immense cost to forge a new history, making it nearly impossible to reverse the entire Bitcoin ledger without controlling 100% of the hashrate for an extended period. The vulnerabilities inherent in PoS raise critical questions about its feasibility for global scalability.

The distinction between internal and external block creation processes is crucial for understanding scalability. PoS participants lock their coins to participate in block creation, resulting in a consistent and orderly process. Conversely, PoW miners engage in a chaotic race to find block solutions, which can lead to inefficiencies.

Researchers have extended the utility of PoW by developing methods to prune consensus data while maintaining security. Under PoW, miners seek block solutions that meet specific difficulty criteria, and the emergence of "superblocks" has been observed, which can be chained together to form a secure record of Proof of Work at a fraction of the original size.

Kaspa employs a pruning mechanism that allows nodes to maintain near-constant storage growth, contrasting with the linear growth experienced by PoS networks. This difference highlights how the security-speed trade-offs in PoS also limit scalability.

In the current cryptocurrency landscape, many users gravitate toward networks like BNB, XRP, and Solana due to their user-friendly experiences, despite being aware of their drawbacks. BNB is centralized, Solana faces outages and lacks a maximum supply, and XRP has a low fault tolerance, all of which impact security and scalability.

Kaspa's unique storage dynamics, enabled by its pruning mechanism, make it more sustainable in the long term. For example, if payment processors handle approximately 2 billion transactions daily, the storage costs for PoS networks would quickly become unsustainable. In contrast, Kaspa's GhostDAG protocol allows for scaling without security-speed trade-offs, making it a more viable solution.

Kaspa's current implementation, while not optimal, is significantly more efficient than other networks with comparable speeds. The decision to rewrite Kaspa in Rust aims to enhance performance and security, addressing the challenges posed by code debt and enabling higher block rates.

Testnet 11 demonstrated that a standard computer could run a node at 10 blocks per second, with a storage ceiling of only 260GB. This testnet successfully handled 150â€“200 million transactions daily without faults, showcasing the potential for Kaspa to support global adoption and new paradigms in cryptocurrency. The future prospects of innovations like DAGKnight and smart contracts, enabled by Kaspa's design, are beginning to materialize, promising exciting developments in the space.
