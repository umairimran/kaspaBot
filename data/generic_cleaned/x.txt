A common misconception about Kaspa ($KAS) is that there are missing transactions for the first six months of the ledger. Here are the facts:

100% of all the data has been recovered for anything after February 10, 2022 (Kaspa launched in November 2021). Additionally, 75% of all the data has been recovered for the period between the launch and February 10, 2022. While 25% remains missing, there is sufficient data to consider this a non-issue.

The genesis block can be found at the following link: [Genesis Block](https://explorer.kaspa.org/blocks/caeb97960a160c211a6b2196bd78399fd4c4cc5b509f55c12c8a7d815f7536ea). The earliest mined block is available here: [Earliest Mined Block](https://explorer.kaspa.org/blocks/d884013dc7b892b793f1f261432fa7de504be574d4f327b1a7a9379a630b96b3).

Concerns have been raised regarding the missing transactions, particularly about the implications of a single entity potentially pre-mining and splitting this into multiple wallets without detection. However, the missing transactions account for roughly 5% of the total diluted supply, which is approximately 1.4 billion Kaspa. Even if the transaction data were available, it would not necessarily prove or disprove that a single entity mined the entire supply, as miners can distribute their coins across multiple addresses.

The missing block data is not contiguous. Due to the efforts of community members to collect and archive old data directories, the missing data is sporadic and randomly scattered among the blocks produced during the first few weeks. Therefore, even if an entity had pre-mined and mined all their coins into a single address, that address would be visible in all the coinbase transactions of the recovered blocks.

Kaspa’s architecture increases bandwidth and orphan risk requirements for full nodes, which may limit the number of individuals who can validate the network independently, potentially leading to centralization. Unlike Bitcoin, which employs a layered approach similar to the internet, Kaspa's fast emission schedule results in steep declines in block rewards by 2028. Unless transaction fees rise significantly, the long-term assumptions of this model may break down, as the cost for an attacker to launch a 51% attack decreases over time compared to Bitcoin.

In terms of node requirements as of 2025, the following comparisons can be made:

- **Bitcoin Full Node (Pruned)**: ~10–20 GB disk space, ~1–2 GB RAM, low bandwidth requirements, very high accessibility.
- **Kaspa Full Node (Archival)**: ~40–100 GB+ disk space, 8–16 GB+ RAM, medium to high bandwidth requirements, decreasing accessibility.
- **Kaspa Full Node (Pruned)**: ~10–25 GB disk space, 4–8 GB+ RAM, medium bandwidth requirements, mixed accessibility.
- **Ethereum Archival Node**: 2–5 TB+ disk space, 32 GB+ RAM, high bandwidth requirements, very low accessibility.
- **Ethereum Full Node (Pruned)**: ~500 GB+ disk space, 8–16 GB RAM, high bandwidth requirements, limited accessibility.

Kaspa's pruning does reduce disk space, which is beneficial, but it does not reduce the validation load. The high block rate and DAG logic mean that higher CPU and bandwidth needs remain. While pruning can lower disk usage, it is still not as accessible or lightweight as Bitcoin, especially for users on older hardware or low-bandwidth networks.

Kaspa's design choices prioritize decentralization, security, and throughput. The project has no corporate issuer, no pre-mine, and no venture capital allocation, which fosters a grassroots Proof-of-Work community. The consensus mechanism, GHOSTDAG, allows for multiple blocks to be created concurrently while maintaining a consistent order, thus enabling high throughput without sacrificing decentralization.

Critics often misunderstand Kaspa's architecture, equating speed with centralization and overlooking the unique properties of its BlockDAG structure. The project aims to maintain a lean base layer focused on sound money properties, allowing for the development of Layer 2 solutions without bloating the primary layer.

In summary, Kaspa is designed to address the limitations of traditional blockchain architectures while ensuring decentralization and security. The project continues to evolve, focusing on community-driven development and open-source contributions.
