3. Organize content into clear paragraphs
4. Fix any obvious typos or formatting issues
5. Preserve technical terms, algorithm names, and specific details exactly as written
6. Remove any promotional content or calls-to-action
7. Ensure the text flows logically and is easy to read
8. Keep the technical depth and accuracy intact

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Clean, well-formatted paragraphs
- No headers/footers/navigation
- Technical content preserved exactly
- Professional, informative tone
- Ready for embedding in a knowledge base
